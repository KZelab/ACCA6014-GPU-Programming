/**
 * UpdateCameraVectors - Converts Euler angles to direction vectors
 *
 * SPHERICAL TO CARTESIAN CONVERSION:
 * We're essentially converting spherical coordinates (yaw, pitch) to a
 * Cartesian direction vector (x, y, z).
 *
 * In spherical coordinates:
 *   - yaw (θ) = azimuthal angle in XZ plane (rotation around Y)
 *   - pitch (φ) = elevation angle from XZ plane (rotation around X)
 *
 * The formulas derived from spherical coordinates:
 *   x = cos(pitch) × cos(yaw)
 *   y = sin(pitch)
 *   z = cos(pitch) × sin(yaw)
 *
 * VISUALIZATION:
 *
 *        +Y (up)
 *         |   /front (pitch > 0)
 *         |  /
 *         | / pitch angle
 *         |/_________ +X
 *        /\
 *       /  \ yaw angle
 *      /    \
 *    +Z      front projected on XZ plane
 *
 * The cos(pitch) term "squishes" the XZ components as we look up/down,
 * keeping the direction vector normalized.

 *
 * glm::mix(a, b, t) implements this: returns a when t=0, b when t=1
 *
 * EXPONENTIAL SMOOTHING:
 * Using (smoothFactor × deltaTime) as t creates exponential decay toward target:
 * - Each frame moves a percentage of the remaining distance
 * - Creates smooth, natural-feeling deceleration
 * - Larger smoothFactor = faster response
 * - Movement is frame-rate independent due to deltaTime

 * - Audio parameter smoothing

 * In both cases, after 1 second: 60 × 0.083 = 30 × 0.167 = 5 units

// =============================================================================
/**
 * ProcessMouse - Converts mouse movement to camera rotation
 *
 * SENSITIVITY SCALING:
 * Raw pixel offsets are too large for direct use as angles.
 * mouseSensitivity (e.g., 0.1) converts pixels to degrees:
 *   10 pixels of movement = 1 degree of rotation
 *
 * AXIS MAPPING:
 * - Horizontal mouse movement (xOffset) → Yaw (rotate left/right)
 * - Vertical mouse movement (yOffset) → Pitch (look up/down)
 *
 * Note: yOffset is SUBTRACTED from pitch because screen Y is inverted
 * (already handled in processInput, but the sign here reinforces the intent).
 *
 * GIMBAL LOCK AND PITCH CLAMPING:
 * We clamp pitch to ±89° (not ±90°) to prevent issues:
 *
 * At exactly ±90° pitch (looking straight up/down):
 * - The front vector becomes parallel to worldUp
 * - cross(front, worldUp) = 0 (undefined/zero right vector)
 * - The camera orientation becomes undefined
 *
 * This is related to GIMBAL LOCK - a loss of one degree of freedom
 * when two rotation axes align. Clamping to 89° keeps us just shy
 * of this singularity while still allowing near-vertical views.
 *
 * Alternative solutions include:
 * - Quaternions (no gimbal lock, but more complex)
 * - Different rotation orders
 * - Accepting the limitation (most FPS games do this)

 * Orbit - Rotates camera around a target point (arcball-style)

 * ORBIT CAMERA CONCEPT:
 * Instead of rotating in place (FPS), the camera moves on a sphere
 * centered at targetPosition, always facing the target.
 *
 * Think of it like a satellite orbiting Earth:
 * - The satellite (camera) maintains a fixed distance (radius)
 * - It can move around the sphere's surface
 * - It always points toward the center (target)
 *
 * SPHERICAL COORDINATES FOR ORBIT:
 * The camera position is computed from:
 * - radius: Distance from target (constant during orbit)
 * - yaw: Angle around the vertical axis (longitude)
 * - pitch: Angle above/below the horizontal plane (latitude)
 *
 * POSITION CALCULATION:
 *   x = target.x + radius × cos(yaw) × cos(pitch)
 *   y = target.y + radius × sin(pitch)
 *   z = target.z + radius × sin(yaw) × cos(pitch)
 *
 * This is the same spherical-to-Cartesian conversion used in UpdateCameraVectors,
 * but offset from targetPosition instead of origin.
 *
