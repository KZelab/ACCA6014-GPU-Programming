## Educational Progression Notes

**Mathematical Complexity:**
-  Basic 2D/3D math
-  Transformation matrices and geometry
-  Advanced 3D mathematics and file I/O
-  Performance optimization and advanced algorithms

**Technical Complexity:**
- Early branches focus on fundamental concepts
- Mid branches introduce real-world asset management
- Later branches cover production optimization techniques

**Dependencies:**
- Camera work (11-14) builds foundation for mesh work (15-16)
- Mesh loading and texturing (15-16) enables meaningful batching (17-18)
- Each branch builds incrementally on previous concepts

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Maintain Test Framework**: Each branch adds new interactive tests
2. **Preserve Educational Value**: Include detailed README with concepts and experiments
3. **Build Incrementally**: Each branch should work standalone but build on previous work
4. **Focus on Understanding**: Emphasize why techniques work, not just how to implement them
